After the huge success from last year, the Eclipse Foundation again joins efforts with the openHAB Foundation to host another Smart Home Day co-located with EclipseCon Europe in Ludwigsburg.

Smart Home Day is on the Sunday before the start of EclipseCon Europe (October 21), making it easy to attend both events without the need for any additional travel.

The Smart Home Day focuses specifically on Eclipse SmartHome-based solutions such as openHAB and QIVICON. It is an awesome opportunity for all community members to meet and exchange ideas.

There will be great talks from core project maintainers, solution providers, and other community members. The agenda has been carefully compiled to addresses developers, tech-savvy users, and other smart home enthusiasts alike.
