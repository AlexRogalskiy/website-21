Free Software and Open Source - these are the topics of FrOSCon (Free and Open Source Software Conference). Every year in August the computer science department of the University of Applied Sciences Bonn-Rhein-Sieg, supported by FrOSCon e.V., will organize an exciting program with talks and workshops for visitors of all ages. The event is topped off with a fair of booths from FLOSS projects and companies. The social event, celebrated at Saturday night, offers the opportunity to exchange opinions with other visitors, speakers or volunteers.

[The talk about SmartHome](https://programm.froscon.de/2019/events/2460.html) is scheduled for Saturday, 03:15pm.

BTW: We need some more openHAB ambassadors at our booth :) [Join the discussion](https://community.openhab.org/t/froscon-2019/73353/14).
