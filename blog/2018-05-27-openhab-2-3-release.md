Time flies! The last openHAB release is already more than 5 months old and much has happened since then. It is therefore clearly time to pack and ship all the nice new updates as a stable release: Here comes [openHAB 2.3](https://www.openhab.org/download/)!

All details about the included features and fixes are listed in the [official Release Notes](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-distro/releases/tag/2.3.0), but please allow me to point you to some of my personal highlights:

### Localisation

A lot of effort went into translation work during the past months: Not only the openHAB dashboard, but also HABPanel and the Android app have been translated into many languages by community members all over the world. We are using the [Crowdin service](https://crowdin.com/projects?q=openhab) for this, which makes it really easy for people to contribute - it is a perfect start for actively participating in the community!

### Units of Measurement

Another great feature that makes it much easier to use openHAB all over the world is the new support for units on numbers. 
Last but not least I should mention that we also have updates for the [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/openhab/id492054521?mt=8) and the [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openhab.habdroid) available in the app stores - especially the Android app has evolved a lot and it is awesome to see many new contributors being involved in it - check out all the new features and fixes in [its release notes](https://github.com/openhab/openhab.android/releases/tag/2.0.0).
For the 2.2 release, we plan to come up with 2.2.x updates, which can potentially fix critical issues that are found, but which will more importantly add further bindings that are going to be merged during the next weeks. Our aim is to make the time that it takes for a new binding to become available to our release users much shorter than it is today. So stay tuned for further news on this!
I hope that you like all those updates and I really think that openHAB becomes much better with every release. This wouldn't be possible without its great community. So let me end my annoucement by thanking all contributors that drive the project forward - be it through code contributions, work on the documentation or simply by reporting bugs and involving themselves in discussions. Merry christmas to all of you!
